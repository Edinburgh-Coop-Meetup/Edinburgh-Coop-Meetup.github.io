We’ve been talking about putting together a website for this event for a while, and at our event on the 9th February 
we held a workshop to explore what we wanted to do.

We all answered some questions on post it notes and then talked about each question as a group:

*  What messages do we want to send about Scottish Co-ops?
*  What different types of people are we trying to reach?
*  What information do we want to convey? & How will people use this information?
*  What information would you want to contribute? What can we encourage others to contribute? What information can we use from elsewhere?
*  Should it be Edinburgh? or how can we involve the rest of Scotland? What can we do that is unique for this area?

We decided to start with a small website to get information about our regular Edinburgh event shared and online. 
If we want to encourage more people to join we need to make sure the information about our event is open, easy to find 
and accessible.

However, there is clearly interest in doing much more than this. This includes advocating for co-ops and listing local 
co-ops, people and resources. However we know keeping this kind of resource useful and up to date is a challenge, so we 
want to give this very careful consideration to make sure we do this well. This is a topic we’ll return to in the 
future, and we’ll start by listing useful information in our links section.
